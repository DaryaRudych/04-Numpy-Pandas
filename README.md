In this project I use pandas library to analyze mock purchase data for a fantasy videogame "Pymoli". Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As part of this project, I break down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights and provide key findings.
